    <h3>Accounting for sales tax (VAT, GST) cash method. Cash method vs accrual method.</h3>

    <p><b>Keywords: Accounting for sales tax cash method, cash method vs accrual method.</b></p>

    <h4>Basic principles.</h4>
    <p>At first, it's need to understand these things:
      <ul>
        <li>Prepaid merchandise - means that buyer has paid 100% for this merchandise, and has not yet received it (merchandise).</li>
        <li>Paid merchandise - means that buyer has paid or prepaid 100% for this merchandise and has received it (merchandise).</li>
        <li>Prepaid (paid partially) merchandise - means that buyer has paid less than 100% for this merchandise.</li>
        <li>Sold merchandise - means that buyer has received this merchandise*.</li>
      </ul>
      *For some countries, the term "merchandise is sold" may mean that the merchandise has been sent to a customer.
      In the Beigesoft™ EIS a merchandise is "sold or bought" when the invoice (with this merchandise) is posted (the document has made accounting entries).
    </p>
    <p>Accrual and cash methods are dedicated for making income tax "WHEN" (all other taxes usually have the same method as income tax).</p>
    <p>The most used method for income tax is:
    <pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">
      Income tax = (Business revenue - Business expenses) * Tax Rate
    </pre>
    There are two methods "WHEN" revenue or expense is occurred:
    <ul>
      <li>CASH method - means that expense/revenue/tax is occurs when merchandise is sold and paid.</li>
      <li>ACCRUAL method - means that expense/revenue/tax is occurs when merchandise is sold (even unpaid or partially paid).</li>
    </ul>
    Cash method is used only in tax accounting and only in simple cases - when income is low.
    The accrual basis is the only reliable method for properly assessing business performance and is used in financial accounting.
    If you have a choice between these methods for tax accounting, then you should better choose the accrual method.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Sales tax cash method</h4>
    <p>In some countries the law may demand to use the cash method for sales tax despite using the accrual method for income tax.</p>
    <p>In Beigesoft™ EIS you can use this method for sales, purchases and their returns.</p>
    <p>Let's make sales for example. At first, set enabled these "Entries sources":
      <ul>
        <li><b>Sales taxes methods must be switched according to current rules (here is: Cash=On, Accrual=Off)</b></li>
        <li><b>Sales:</b></li>
        <li>#27 "Payment from. Debit Receivable per customer, Credit Sales taxes payable per tax for tax amount, when Payments>=Sales, CASH!!!" set on.</li>
        <li>#26 "Sales invoice. Debit Receivable per customer, Credit Sales taxes payable per tax for tax amount, when Payments>=Sales, CASH!!!" set on.</li>
        <li>#11 "Sales invoice. Debit Receivable per customer, Credit Sales taxes payable per tax for tax amount." set off.</li>
        <li>#30 "Sales return. Debit Sales tax receivable from returns per Tax, Credit Returns Payable per Customer for tax amount, when Payments+Returns>=Sales, CASH!!!" set on.</li>
        <li>#17 "Sales return. Debit Sales tax receivable from returns per Tax, Credit Returns Payable per Customer for tax amount." set off.</li>
        <li><b>Purchases:</b></li>
        <li>#29 "Payment to. Debit Sales tax from purchase per tax, Credit Payable per vendor for tax amount, when Payments>=Purchases, CASH!!!" set on.</li>
        <li>#28 "Purchase invoice. Debit Sales tax from purchase per tax, Credit Payable per vendor for tax amount, when Payments>=Purchases, CASH!!!" set on.</li>
        <li>#4 "Purchase invoice. Debit Sales tax from purchase per tax, Credit Payable per vendor for tax amount." set off.</li>
        <li>#31 "Purchase return. Debit Returns Receivable per vendor, Credit Sales Tax Payable from returns per Tax for tax amount, when Payments+Returns>=Purchases, CASH!!!" set on.</li>
        <li>#15 "Purchase return. Debit Returns Receivable per vendor, Credit Sales Tax Payable from returns per Tax for tax amount." set off.</li>
      </ul>
      Also set the "Extract sales taxes from sales" property to "ON" in the accounting settings. Example of switching entries source, e.g.:
    </p>
    <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/entrsour.png" /></p>
    <h4>Case #1. A 100% prepaid sales invoice.</h4>
    <p>Add a 100% "prepayment to a vendor (13 Jul. 2016, 668.54$ total) and post it.
      Then add a sales invoice (14 Jul. 2016, 668.54$ total) with that prepayment:
    </p>
    <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/satacashinv1.png" /></p>
    <p>After the invoice has been posted, the report is:
    </p>
    <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/satacashinv2.png" /></p>
    <p>As you can see, it made all the accounting entries: taxes, receivable to revenue, inventory to COGS, adjusting prepayments to receivable.</p>
    
    <h4>Case #2. A 50% prepaid sales invoice plus 25%*2 payments.</h4>
    <p>Add a 50% prepayment to a vendor (15 Jul. 2016, 334.27$ total) and post it.
      Then add a sales invoice with the same goods and services as above ones (17 Jul. 2016, 668.54$ total),
      then post it. The report is:
    </p>
    <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/satacashinv3.png" /></p>
    <p>As you can see, it made only part of the accounting entries: receivable to revenue, inventory to COGS, adjusting prepayments to receivable.</p>
    <p>Then add a payment (18 Jul. 2016, 167.14$ total) and post it:
    </p>
    <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/satacashpay1.png" /></p>
    <p>As you can see, it made only the cash to receivable accounting entries.</p>
    <p>Then add the rest payment (19 Jul. 2016, 167.13$ total) and post it:
    </p>
    <p align="center"><img style="max-width: 100%" src="images/satacashpay2.png" /></p>
    <p>As you can see, it made the cash to receivable and taxes to receivable accounting entries.</p>
