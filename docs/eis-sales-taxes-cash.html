<h4>Basic principles.<a name="Basic_principles."></a></h4>
    
<p>At first, it's need to understand these things:
      </p>
<ul>
        
<li>Prepaid merchandise - means that buyer has paid 100% for this merchandise, and has not yet received it (merchandise).</li>
        
<li>Paid merchandise - means that buyer has paid or prepaid 100% for this merchandise and has received it (merchandise).</li>
        
<li>Prepaid (paid partially) merchandise - means that buyer has paid less than 100% for this merchandise.</li>
        
<li>Sold merchandise - means that buyer has received this merchandise*.</li>
      </ul>
      *For some countries, the term &quot;merchandise is sold&quot; may mean that the merchandise has been sent to a customer.
      In the Beigesoft&#x2122; EIS a merchandise is &quot;sold or bought&quot; when the invoice (with this merchandise) is posted (the document has made accounting entries).
    
    
<p>Accrual and cash methods are dedicated for making income tax &quot;WHEN&quot; (all other taxes usually have the same method as income tax).</p>
    
<p>The most used method for income tax is:
    </p>
<div>
<pre style="white-space:pre-wrap">
      Income tax = (Business revenue - Business expenses) * Tax Rate
    </pre></div>
    There are two methods &quot;WHEN&quot; revenue or expense is occurred:
    
<ul>
      
<li>CASH method - means that expense/revenue/tax is occurs when merchandise is sold and paid.</li>
      
<li>ACCRUAL method - means that expense/revenue/tax is occurs when merchandise is sold (even unpaid or partially paid).</li>
    </ul>
    Cash method is used only in tax accounting and only in simple cases - when income is low.
    The accrual basis is the only reliable method for properly assessing business performance and is used in financial accounting.
    If you have a choice between these methods for tax accounting, then you should better choose the accrual method.
    
    
    </div>
<div class="section">
<h4>Sales tax cash method<a name="Sales_tax_cash_method"></a></h4>
    
<p>In some countries the law may demand to use the cash method for sales tax despite using the accrual method for income tax.</p>
    
<p>In Beigesoft&#x2122; EIS you can use this method for sales, purchases and their returns.</p>
    
<p>Let's make sales for example. At first, set enabled these &quot;Entries sources&quot;:
      </p>
<ul>
        
<li><b>Sales taxes methods must be switched according to current rules (here is: Cash=On, Accrual=Off)</b></li>
        
<li><b>Sales:</b></li>
        
<li>#27 &quot;Payment from. Debit Receivable per customer, Credit Sales taxes payable per tax for tax amount, when Payments&gt;=Sales, CASH!!!&quot; set on.</li>
        
<li>#26 &quot;Sales invoice. Debit Receivable per customer, Credit Sales taxes payable per tax for tax amount, when Payments&gt;=Sales, CASH!!!&quot; set on.</li>
        
<li>#11 &quot;Sales invoice. Debit Receivable per customer, Credit Sales taxes payable per tax for tax amount.&quot; set off.</li>
        
<li>#30 &quot;Sales return. Debit Sales tax receivable from returns per Tax, Credit Returns Payable per Customer for tax amount, when Payments+Returns&gt;=Sales, CASH!!!&quot; set on.</li>
        
<li>#17 &quot;Sales return. Debit Sales tax receivable from returns per Tax, Credit Returns Payable per Customer for tax amount.&quot; set off.</li>
        
<li><b>Purchases:</b></li>
        
<li>#29 &quot;Payment to. Debit Sales tax from purchase per tax, Credit Payable per vendor for tax amount, when Payments&gt;=Purchases, CASH!!!&quot; set on.</li>
        
<li>#28 &quot;Purchase invoice. Debit Sales tax from purchase per tax, Credit Payable per vendor for tax amount, when Payments&gt;=Purchases, CASH!!!&quot; set on.</li>
        
<li>#4 &quot;Purchase invoice. Debit Sales tax from purchase per tax, Credit Payable per vendor for tax amount.&quot; set off.</li>
        
<li>#31 &quot;Purchase return. Debit Returns Receivable per vendor, Credit Sales Tax Payable from returns per Tax for tax amount, when Payments+Returns&gt;=Purchases, CASH!!!&quot; set on.</li>
        
<li>#15 &quot;Purchase return. Debit Returns Receivable per vendor, Credit Sales Tax Payable from returns per Tax for tax amount.&quot; set off.</li>
      </ul>
      Also set the &quot;Extract sales taxes from sales&quot; property to &quot;ON&quot; in the accounting settings. Example of switching entries source, e.g.:
    
    
<p align="center"><img src="images/entrsour.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="" /></p>
    </div>
<div class="section">
<h4>Case #1. A 100% prepaid sales invoice.<a name="Case_1._A_100_prepaid_sales_invoice."></a></h4>
    
<p>Add a 100% &quot;prepayment to a vendor (13 Jul. 2016, 668.54$ total) and post it.
      Then add a sales invoice (14 Jul. 2016, 668.54$ total) with that prepayment:
    </p>
    
<p align="center"><img src="images/satacashinv1.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="" /></p>
    
<p>After the invoice has been posted, the report is:
    </p>
    
<p align="center"><img src="images/satacashinv2.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="" /></p>
    
<p>As you can see, it made all the accounting entries: taxes, receivable to revenue, inventory to COGS, adjusting prepayments to receivable.</p>
    
    </div>
<div class="section">
<h4>Case #2. A 50% prepaid sales invoice plus 25%*2 payments.<a name="Case_2._A_50_prepaid_sales_invoice_plus_252_payments."></a></h4>
    
<p>Add a 50% prepayment to a vendor (15 Jul. 2016, 334.27$ total) and post it.
      Then add a sales invoice with the same goods and services as above ones (17 Jul. 2016, 668.54$ total),
      then post it. The report is:
    </p>
    
<p align="center"><img src="images/satacashinv3.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="" /></p>
    
<p>As you can see, it made only part of the accounting entries: receivable to revenue, inventory to COGS, adjusting prepayments to receivable.</p>
    
<p>Then add a payment (18 Jul. 2016, 167.14$ total) and post it:
    </p>
    
<p align="center"><img src="images/satacashpay1.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="" /></p>
    
<p>As you can see, it made only the cash to receivable accounting entries.</p>
    
<p>Then add the rest payment (19 Jul. 2016, 167.13$ total) and post it:
    </p>
    
<p align="center"><img src="images/satacashpay2.png" style="max-width: 100%" alt="" /></p>
    
<p>As you can see, it made the cash to receivable and taxes to receivable accounting entries.</p>
