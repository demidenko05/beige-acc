<h3>Why should you choose Beigesoft&#x2122; software (libraries)<a name="Why_should_you_choose_Beigesoft_software_libraries"></a></h3>

    
<p>
      First, an application based on Beigesoft&#x2122; libraries works anywhere. The all parts - ORM, PDF Writer (reporting tool), WEB-interface work on standard Java as well as on Android one.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Second, they are fast. The all parts work fast even on weak devices such as a smartphone. Beige WEB interface is based on JSP. JSP WEB-view technology is the same as PHP, ASPX, etc. This is the dominant WEB-view technology (mostly used).
      JSP is faster than PHP (and other script languages) because of compiling JSP-bytecode into processor code on time (Just In Time bytecode compiler). The Beige-PDF writer caches TTF fonts and makes PDF files with only used characters, so you will never get a huge PDF file or wait a long time for it.
      Standard ORMs use &quot;lazy initialization&quot; to retrieve entity's fields. That means that they use several SQL queries to retrieve whole model.
      Beige ORM retrieves the whole model by using only(single) SQL query (with JOINS). A one big SQL query (exactly with JOINS) that retrieves all data is always faster than several small SQL queries that retrieve the same data.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Third, with these libraries you are able to build very complex business applications quickly. You can check it by yourself by making the example application in the next articles.
      Also look at the Beige-EIS source code and &quot;Bob's pizza&quot; tutorials, i.e. accounting and web-store functionality.
      Beige PDF writer can't make charts or barcodes. It took me 3 months to program Beige PDF. PDF is naturally able to draw lines and shapes. It will not be long or difficult to implement a chart or a bar-code. And this is a regular task even for an IT student.
      Programming a report without a visual editor is actually a reliable and quick way.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Fourth, they and all 3-party software are under truly free licenses. BSD 2-Clause License means:
      </p>
<ul>
        
<li>it's open source (you can modify it)</li>
        
<li>it's free for any purposes (even for commercial purposes)</li>
        
<li>there is no any warranty</li>
        
<li>there is no any liability</li>
        
<li>you must include copyright in any redistribution of these libraries (software that use Beigesoft libraries), e.g. just make a regular HTML page that lists all the parts and their licenses (in the way that's similar to a book)</li>
        
<li>these terms are forever</li>
      </ul>
      They blame that this license is advertising. Have you ever seen a reliable book without reference page? Omitting of used sources in a book is lawless.
      And it's not about advertising, it's about &quot;the authors&quot;, &quot;the terms&quot; and &quot;the author's responsibilities&quot;. There are a lot of useless software (especially duplicates) that just dedicated to waste your time.
      The last time when the Law hits such ugly things in the IT sphere was the &quot;data privacy&quot;. Many business owners bore direct losses because of it, for example imposing additional fees to prevent publishing WHOIS information.
      In other hand, there are software with &quot;non-proper&quot; or &quot;unclear&quot; licenses and authors. Just take a look inside an open-source software, and you might find a part with a non-free or unclear license.

<h4>Why Beige-WEB is a good choice? Creating dynamic WEB interface on Server-side vs Client side.<a name="Why_Beige-WEB_is_a_good_choice_Creating_dynamic_WEB_interface_on_Server-side_vs_Client_side."></a></h4>
    
<p>Dynamic WEB interface is built by usually on server side, or on client one. Both are the same years old.</p>
    
<p>Server side: CGI-BIN (C, PERL,...), PHP, ASP, JSP, ASPX, JEE based Apache Velocity and Wicket; new modern JEE based Thymeleaf, etc. They generate and send whole HTML pages - data and widgets.</p>
    
<p>Client side: a) JavaScript-based: JEE based GWT and JSF, Angular; new modern Node, React, Vue, ...  ; b) WEB-browser's plugin-based.
      Server side send only dynamically data (usually as JSON responses) and static HTML template (usually consist of JS library), any server side applications (PHP, JSP...) can do this,
      i.e. retrieve requested data then send it as a JSON response.
      Client-side WEB-browser plugin or JS library sends request for data, then render widgets (forms, lists) by changing HTML template page dynamically.
      See for example how to render a data-grid by JS on WEB-browser side: https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DataGrid/Overview/AngularJS/Light/.
      Thanks to Google everyone uses its HTML docs. Google boosted JS very hard. So client side JS method took a really huge part of WEB-interfaces.
    </p>
    
<p>
      Anyway there are many cases when both methods are used together, i.e. building dynamic HTML on both client and server sides.
      For example Beige-EIS for WEB-store uses pure JSP even without AJAX. But payment gateway PayPal probably uses client side JS dynamic WEB. 
    </p>
    
<p>Beige-WEB uses server-side JSP pages to generate whole HTML pages or part of them (i.e. data plus HTML tags).
      Beige-WEB uses AJAX requests and JSON responses that modifies HTML page (both widgets and data) partially, e.g. when you push the <b>save</b> button,
      then it will send AJAX request, then a received JSON multi-target response will be used to refresh the form, the underlying list,
      popup message (e.g. update success) and other things that are included into this JSON response.
      Using AJAX and JSON allows to reduce traffic, i.e. it's faster then refreshing the whole page on form submit.
      See for example <b>beige-web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jsp/esj.jsp</b>:

}
&lt;/c:import&gt;
</pre></div>
      This response refreshes entity form (created by <b>jsp/tml/ed.jsp</b> from the passed by the business service the entity model and the settings)
      in the HTML page inside <b>DIV</b> target with ID=<b>${frmMnPl}</b>. And so it does for the entities list (data-grid). JSON response also consists of JavaScripts, i.e. show error/warn/success message and open the modal form.
    
    
<p>Which method are the best? First, ignore buzz words such as &quot;modern&quot;, &quot;newest&quot; (maybe someones use even &quot;cutting age&quot;, &quot;ground breaking&quot; for their libs).
      Ordinary competition (contest) can give a precise answer, so just try different approaches (libs) for real-life complex tasks. For example the invoice and its item forms in Beige-EIS are changed dramatically depending on: a) taxable or not, b) taxes included in price c) taxes item/invoice based d) cumulative tax rate or not e) destination-based sales tax.
      A WEB-store list can show items in very complex way depending of many things. Also try to make generic viewer (rendering entities forms and lists with filters according to settings) similar to Beige-WEB.
      A lot of new libs and frameworks infest, but they do not always impress at the second deep look. They usually support only private key (RDBMS) - either auto-incremented integer or GUID. Beige-WEB supports any private key including composite (it doesn't support GUID because of its cross-platform problems and in favor to its more fast and cross-platform analog, but it can be implemented easy if it's needed, e.g. SQLITE version will be used Text appearance of GUID).
    </p>
    
<p>Client side disadvantages:
      </p>
<ul>
        
<li>I18n - you have to upload all vocabulary(s) into browser</li>
        
<li>you often should pass to browser settings for rendering, so it's no good if you do not want to expose some settings for rendering widgets (e.g. depending on the logged user).</li>
        
<li>again, rendering logic can be very complex and changeable, so using server-side is surely more easy and faster for it.</li>
        
<li>for JS - you face too huge JS libs.</li>
        
<li>for JS - look inside Beige-WEB(exactly EIS), it often uses BigDecimal expressions in JSP. In contrast to it, JavaScript has a lot of danger features (flexibility, JIT-compiler), but has no many very needed things such as Decimal type. You will get troubles by using float type in Math expressions, so you have to use additional JS library for it.</li>
      </ul>
    
    
<p>Server side disadvantages:
      </p>
<ul>
        
<li>Data and widgets are coupled together (classic HTML), so it increases traffic in many cases in contrast to client-side approach. For many cases such as Beige-WEB (i.e. accounting software UI), separating VIEW and DATA in presentation phase is a good way, but it should be an HTML5+ (any extension or plugin) for this, not JS.
          In case of WEB-store, only items images usually do matter for increasing traffic, and huge items descriptions also have more weight than HTML tags.
        </li>
        
<li>because of lack and poor HTML5 implementation (and specification that rely on flexible JS) you must code JavaScript, e.g. Beige-Web's input-number BsInpNum.js and BsNum.js for rounding.</li>
      </ul>
    
    
<p>To create dynamic WEB in optimal and safe way, HTML5+ (an extension) should work without JS. It should be a restricted, strong-typed, narrow-functional language.
      For example, changing input-number with ID=quantity will invoke its &quot;calculation: #total=#quantity*#price&quot;, and inputs #total and #price must be also of number type. Of course inputs must handle decimal places and internationalization by itself (non-JS).
      It also should have dedicated macro-commands for making UI widgets on client side that will work fast without JIT-compiler. So disabling JS never broke such applications.
      If you look at Beige-WEB source code, then you should see that it ready for such this HTML5+ (or a browser's restricted plugin) client side version, i.e. all we need to do is creating new JSP pages that respond with such HTML5+ and JSON responses (they seems to be more optimal than XML) with pure data.
      Servlets and business services will be the same.
