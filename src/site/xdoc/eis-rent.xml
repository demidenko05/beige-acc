  These expenses usually don't require tracking payments to its vendor(supplier), and usually they don't include taxes.
  So accounting of such expenses is very simple.
  Bob rented kitchen on Jan 13 with equipment for 1000USD per month. The document lease is the proof that says that rent expense will occur
  on the last day of every month for 1000USD even unpaid (accrual method).
  <h4>Accounting of prepaid rent.</h4>
  Bob prepaid 3000USD for 3 months and made accounting entries:
  <p align="center"><img alt="Beigesoft™ EIS prepaid rent" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/prepaid-rent.png" /></p>
  <p>
    One month rent is occurred on Jan 31, so Bob will make adjusting entries (transfer 1000USD from prepayments into income (business) expense account <b>5150 Expenses.Rent</b>):
  </p>
  <p align="center"><img alt="Beigesoft™ EIS rent occurred prepaid" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/rent-occurred.png" /></p>
  <p>
    Bob will make similar entries on February and March.
  </p>
  <h4>Accounting of unpaid rent.</h4>
  <p>
    Assume, in April Bob will not pay rent on time, so he will make entries for occurred rent expense:
  </p>
  <p align="center"><img alt="Beigesoft™ EIS rent occurred unpaid" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/rent-occurred-unpaid.png" /></p>
  <p>
    When Bob will pay rent for April, he will make accounting entries:<br></br>
    <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Debit "Accrued Payable.Rent" Credit "Cash In Bank" for 1000 USD</pre>
  </p>
  <h4>Accounting of rent that is paid on time.</h4>
  <p>
    When Bob will pay rent on time, he will make accounting entries:<br></br>
    <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Debit "Expenses.Rent" Credit "Cash In Bank" for 1000 USD</pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    * If according the law of your country a rent expense is required to be capitalized, then you should use asset account <b>1210 Inventory Capitalized Cost.Rent</b> instead of <b>5150 Expenses.Rent</b>.
