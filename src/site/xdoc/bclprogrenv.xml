    <p>The first rule about computer's (your data) safety is: "you must avoid unencrypted HTTP (without ending 'S'") resources".
    If you download something from an unencrypted resource (HTTP), then you must at least check file's "CHECKSUM". It's usually SHA1, SHA256 or SHA512.
    You must use software from official, well known sources. Sometimes search engines list scam resources at the fist lines.
    </p>
    <p>
     You must use the latest version of a reliable browser. Beigesoft WEB interface is based on HTML5 dialogs. Google Chrome and Opera supports it (HTML5 dialogs), so you have to use one of them.
    </p>

    <h4>Installing JDK on Unix-like OS.</h4>
    <p>I recommend Debian Scretch (9) with LXDE interface. There is its 32bit version.
      To install OpenJDK on Debian based linux just run as "root" "apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk" or "sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk".
      On Red Hat based Linux run "dnf install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel".
      Then set environment variables in the <b>.bashrc</b> file, for Debian example:
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
export ANT_HOME=$HOME/programmer/java/apache-ant-1.10.6
export CATALINA_HOME=$HOME/programmer/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.96
export TOMCATA_HOME=$HOME/programmer/java/apache-tomcat-7.0.68a
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
export H2DRIVERS=$HOME/.m2/repository/org/postgresql/postgresql/9.4-1206-jdbc4/postgresql-9.4-1206-jdbc4.jar:$HOME/.m2/repository/org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/3.21.0.1/sqlite-jdbc-3.21.0.1.jar:$HOME/.m2/repository/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.40/mysql-connector-java-5.1.40.jar
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/programmer/java/apache-maven-3.6.2/bin:$ANT_HOME/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
</pre>
* you will create folders that is described in the environment variables, and maven artifacts will be downloaded in the next steps.
    </p>

    <h4>Installing JDK on MS Windows.</h4>
    <p>You can use OpenJDK included in "Android Studio". You need Android Studio to make Android version. You should install it first.
      This is not difficult even for beginners, just download it from official Android site https://developer.android.com and install by default settings.
      You will no need to check its signature by hand, MS Windows will show it.
    </p>

    <h4>Installing Apache Maven</h4>
    <p>Maven 3.6.2 signed by signature that not exists in https://www.apache.org/dist/maven/KEYS.
      This signature exists in https://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/KEYS.
    </p>
    <p>Just create folder e.g. "$HOME/programmer/java/" for Unix like OS, or "C:\programmer\java" for MS Windows.
    Then download apache-maven-3.6.2.zip from https://maven.apache.org/, check its checksum and unpack it there.
    </p>
    <p>
    To check checksum on MS Windows open Power Shell (or CMD) in the Downloads folder (there is the file) and type in the command line:
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
certUtil -hashfile [pathToFileToCheck] [HashAlgorithm]

i.e. run:

certUtil -hashfile apache-maven-3.6.2-bin.zip SHA512

and check it against SHA512 on the site: https://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.6.2/binaries/apache-maven-3.6.2-bin.zip.sha512
</pre>  
    </p>
    <p>To check checksum on Unix like OS type "SHA1SUM [pathToFile]" or "SHA256SUM [pathToFile]" or "SHA512SUM [pathToFile]".
    GnuPg already installed:
<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
1. Open terminal and login as root
2. download public keys:
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/KEYS
3. import public keys:
gpg --import KEYS
4. download Maven:
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.6.2/binaries/apache-maven-3.6.2-bin.tar.gz
5. download Maven's signature:
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.6.2/binaries/apache-maven-3.6.2-bin.tar.gz.asc
6. check signature:
gpg --verify https://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.6.2/binaries/apache-maven-3.6.2-bin.tar.gz.asc
</pre>
  On Unix like OS you have to download installation files under the ROOT user.
  This guaranty that Only ROOT can change these binaries files.
    </p>

    <h4>Installing Beige libraries sources.</h4>
    <p>Just download the first release of beige-blc from https://github.com/demidenko05/beige-blc/releases and beige-web from https://github.com/demidenko05/beige-blc/releases. Then unpack them into "programmer/java" folder.</p>

    

    <h4>Making environment variables in MS Windows</h4>
    <p>
      On MS Windows 10 open "Search" and type "env" then "Edit the system environment variables" will be listed, so choose it,
      "System Properties" window will be appeared,
      switch to "Advanced" then push "Environment variables",
      then add or change:
      <ul>
        <li>Set JAVA_HOME to standard location C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jre (check it out)</li>
        <li>ANDROID_HOME - in Android Studio open SDK manager to see Android SDK Location</li>
        <li>Path - leave all entries and add
          <ul>
            <li>C:\programmer\java\apache-maven-3.6.2\bin</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      After saving, check it: open Power Shell and type "$env:JAVA_HOME" or "$env:Path"
    </p>
  
    <h4>Installing Maven artifacts - all 3-d party libraries.</h4>
    <p>We need at least downloaded SQlite library for H2 datbase tool. Just open Power Shell in <b>beige-blc</b> folder
     and type "mvn clean install". Maven will download all needed libraries into "C:\users\[your name]\.m2\repository".
    </p>

    <h4>Making environment variable H2DRIVERS in MS Windows</h4>
    <p>
      Open "System Properties" - "Environment variables" as described above,
      then add variable H2DRIVERS and choose just downloaded file "C:\users\[your name]\.m2\repository\org\xerial\sqlite-jdbc\3.21.0.1\sqlite-jdbc-3.21.0.1.jar".
      After saving, check it: open Power Shell and type "$env:H2DRIVERS"
    </p>

    <h4>Installing Apache Tomcat</h4>
    <p>Install its latest 7.0.96 version from https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi by using the same way as Maven installation.
    Copy these libraries into its "lib" folder from maven repository:
    <ul>
      <li>[path to maven local repository]\.m2\repository\org\xerial\sqlite-jdbc\3.21.0.1\sqlite-jdbc-3.21.0.1.jar</li>
      <li>[path to maven local repository]\.m2\repository\org\slf4j\slf4j-api\1.7.12\slf4j-api-1.7.12.jar</li>
      <li>[path to maven local repository]\.m2\repository\com\zaxxer\HikariCP\2.4.3\HikariCP-2.4.3.jar</li>
    </ul>
      
    </p>

    <h4>Installing H2 database</h4>
    <p>We never use H2 database. We will use its very useful SQL tool with WEB interface.
    Install it from https://www.h2database.com/html/download.html (last version platform independent ZIP, check its SHA1 and unpack it into "programmer\java" folder).
    </p>

    <h4>Installing text editor</h4>
    <p>I recommend Geany https://www.geany.org/download/releases/ . On Linux you can install it "apt-get install geany".</p>
