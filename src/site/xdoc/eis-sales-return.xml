        Bob sold on Jan 18 4 Pizza with bacon frozen and 4 Pizza with cheese frozen to Funny coffee shop.
        Bob has filled sales invoice (see <a href="eis-selling.html">Accounting of Sales.</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        Bob was confirmed on Jan 19 that Funny coffee shop is bankrupt, and he was received sales return 2 Pizza with bacon frozen and 2 Pizza with cheese frozen.
      </p>

      <p>Bob filled new sales return for the sales invoice:
          <p align="center"><img alt="Beigesoft™ EIS sales return" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/salreturn.png" /></p>
      </p>
      <p>It made complex accounting/warehouse entries:
          <p align="center"><img alt="Beigesoft™ EIS sales return report" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/salreturn1.png" /></p>
          * here COGS accounting entries are made by using COGS entries from the sales invoice (see previous article), so pizza with bacon cost 21.84 for 6, and 21.84/6*2=7.28
      </p>
      <p>
        * Sales returns are business expenses (deducting income tax).
        If according the law of your country accrual method means that business expense occurs when you have received document (proof)
        even though you haven't received goods yet (in the same day), then (in this case) switch off Entries cource#16 "Sales Return, Debit Goods sales returns per good category, Credit Returns Payable per Customer for subtotal amount." and make
        these deducting income accounting entries by hand.
