      <p>On 16 Jan Bob found that 12 eggs and 1 pound of cheese are not fresh.
        At first he switched off entries source #15 "	Purchase return. Debit Returns Receivable per vendor, Credit Sales Tax Payable from returns per Tax for tax amount.".
        Then he has made purchase return to Carlo's grocery:
        <p align="center"><img alt="Beigesoft™ EIS purchase returns" style="max-width: 100%" src="images/purchret.png" /></p>
        * you can change cost (price) (it's still picked automatically), and you can change tax amount (if taxes are extracted from purchase).
      </p>
      <p>Field <b>Site from</b> is optional. If it's empty then withdrawal will be from the first warehouse
        site/s with available item/s.</p>
      <p>Purchase return makes complex accounting, warehouse and draw goods entries:

      </p>
